    wiki: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white_shark",
    alttext: "An image of a great white shark.",
    size: "Males begin to mature at 7.8 ft [2.4 m], and may reach 18 ft [5.5 m]. Maximum length is at least 20.9 ft [6.4 m], possibly over 26.25 ft [8 m]. (Source: Shark Research Institute)",
    diet: "In general, juveniles feed on fish, while adult sharks feed primarily on marine mammals. (Source: Shark Research Institute)",
    behavior: "This is the super-predator; it is without question the most formidable of all sharks. The white shark swims stiffly, and is capable of great speed. A shark, implanted with a sonic tag, had an average cruising speed of 3.2 kph. The shark sometimes raises its head above the water (called, “spy hops”), a behavior frequently observed in the vicinity of seal colonies and in baited situations.

    { id: '2', species: 'Bull Shark', 
    wiki: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_shark",
    alttext: "An image of a bull shark.",
    size: "Males mature at 5.1 to 7.4 ft [1.57 to 2.26 m], and reach at least 9.8 ft [2.9 m]. Females mature at 5.9 to 7.5 ft [1.8 to 2.3 m], and reach a length of 10.6 ft [3.24 m]. (Source: Shark Research Institute)",
    diet: "The shark feeds primarily on bony fishes, but it is a versatile and opportunistic feeder and will eat smaller sharks, skates, turtles, birds, mammals, crustaceans and offal and garbage. The shark uses the teeth of its lower jaw to impale prey, then it swings its head from side-to-side using the heavy triangular teeth of its upper jaw to carve a mouthful of tissue from its prey. (Source: Shark Research Institute)",
    behavior: "General – divers report that the sharks are rarely seen at the surface; most are observed cruising over the top of the reef, and are frequently hosts to remoras. (Source: Shark Research Institute)",
    reproduction: "Viviparous, with yolk-sac placenta. Litter size ranges from 1 to 13. Size at birth is 22 to 31 inches [56 to 81 cm]. Gestation lasts nearly a year. (Source: Shark Research Institute)" },
    { id: '3', species: 'Tiger Shark', 
    wiki: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_shark",
    alttext: "An image of a tiger shark.",
    size: "Most individuals encountered by divers range between 11 and 14 ft [3.4 to 4.3 m] in length. Males mature at 7.4 to 9.5 ft [2.26 to 2.9 m], and reach a length of at least 12.1 ft [3.7 m]. Females mature between 8.2 and 11.5 ft [2.5 and 3.5 m] and reach a length of more than 18 ft [5.5 m]. One large female caught in 1957 was 24 ft [7.4 m] and weighed 3,110 lbs [1,414 kg], and there is an unverified report of a 30 ft [9.1 m] individual. (Source: Shark Research Institute)",
    diet: "The tiger shark is omnivorous; it may attempt to consume virtually anything that can fit between its jaws. It feeds on bony fish, sharks, rays, marine turtles, marine mammals, sea snakes, sea birds, crustaceans, octopus and squid, jellyfish, carrion and garbage. (Source: Shark Research Institute)",
    behavior: "The shark is usually solitary, but may be found in small groups of up to 6 individuals. This species is nocturnal; it comes inshore at night to feed and retreats offshore by day but often feeds near the surface on overcast days. (Source: Shark Research Institute)",
    reproduction: "Ovoviviparous. Gestation is slightly over a year and the litters are large: 10 to 82 pups. Pups, born at a length of 20 to 30 inches [51 to 76 cm], double in length within the first year, but their rate of growth slows as they mature. Most will reach sexual maturity within 7 to 10 years.

    { id: '4', species: 'Whale Shark', 
    wiki: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark",
    alttext: "An image of a whale shark.",
    size: "At birth, the shark is 1.8-2.1 ft [55-64 cm] in length. Males mature at over 19.7 ft [6 m] while females mature at more than 26.2 ft [8 m]. Its maximum length is possibly between 55.8 and 68.9 ft [17 and 21 m]. (Source: Shark Research Institute)",
    diet: "Tagging and photo-identification of individuals indicate regular visits to favored feeding sites to feed at annual, seasonal, or lunar fish and invertebrate spawning events. The high density of plankton produced on these occasions is consumed by suction feeding and gulping, often while hanging vertically. (Source: Shark Research Institute)",
    behavior: "Whale sharks are known to divers as “gentle giants” due to their placid nature. SRI has placed visual and satellite tags on more than 800 whale sharks in an effort to discover their migratory routes. Long-distance, long-term migrations are undertaken; the longest so far recorded was 8077.8 miles [13,000 km] (in one direction only) over a 37 month timespan. (Source: Shark Research Institute)",

    diet: "Plankton (Source: Shark Research Institute)",
    behavior: "Highly migratory. Often seen feeding on surface aggregations of plankton, moving slowly forward with open mouth. The sharks are sometimes seen in large groups. Complex courtship behavior has been reported. Can leap out of the water. (Source: Shark Research Institute)",

    diet: "Spiny dogfish are opportunistic feeders, eating whatever prey is available. They mainly eat small, schooling pelagic fish such as herring, and small invertebrates such as shrimp, crab, and squid. (Source: NOAA Fisheries)",
    behavior: "This species may form large aggregations on feeding grounds. (Source: Shark Research Institute)",
    reproduction: "Aplacental viviparous, with an 18 to 24 month gestation period before giving birth. Litters average up to 20 pups. (Source: Shark Research Institute)" },
